  <h1>Bryan Miller</h1>

  <p>Hello there. My name is <em>Bryan Miller</em> and this site was made possible by the Odin Project cirriculum.</p>

  <p><strong>What is the Odin Project?</strong> I'm glad you asked! It's a fantastic online resource that guides those interested in pursuing a web development career through a self-guided learning experience. It's fully open source and it's updated regularly by a dedicated community.</p>

  <h2>The Inspiration</h2>

  <p>In the spring of 2022, a rare opportunity presented itself at work. I was invited to participate in a book club. Over the course of 5 weeks, I read <em>The Oz Principal: Getting Results Through Individual and Organizational Accountability</em> by Craig Hickman, Tom Smith, and Roger Connors.</p>

  <p>Equipped with a notepad and highlighters, I tackled the Oz Principle chapter by chapter.</p>

  <p>The topic of accountability did not initially excite me. The limited encounters I had with the word <em>accountability</em> were negative, after mistakes were made and someone needed to be blamed.</p>

  <p>However, the Oz Principle defines accountability as:</p>

  <p>"a personal choice to rise above one's circumstances and demonstrate the ownership necessary for achieving desired
  results to See It, Own It, Solve It, and Do It."</p>
