# My Odin Project Progress

Welcome to my walk-through of [_The Odin Project_](https://www.theodinproject.com). T.O.P. is a free, open source curriculum that helps aspiring students become full stack web developers.

The purpose of this repo is to track all progress made toward [_my primary goals_](#goals), to showcase my project work and to provide a central location for my web development notes.

## Project List

These assignments were tackled with a growth mindset and I did not reference the work of others while completing them. In other words, these are _learner's solutions_, written with the intent of practicing the fundamentals and developing problem solving skills.
