# My Odin Project Progress

Welcome to Bryan Miller's walk-through of [_The Odin Project_](https://www.theodinproject.com). T.O.P. is a free, open source curriculum that helps aspiring students become full stack web developers.

The purpose of this repo is to document all progress made toward [_my primary goals_](#goals) and to provide a central location for my web development notes.
