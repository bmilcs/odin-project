# Express

Express: the tiny & simple Node framework

- Handles HTTP verbs with different URL paths / routes
- Integrates w/ "view" engines: generate respones by inserting data in templates
- Set common web app settings: port, template location
- Add request processing "middleware" anywhere in the request handling pipeline
- Unopinionated

Hello World:

```js
// create an express app by importing express module
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// route definition
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  // send response string
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

// start server on a port
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`);
});
```

To creating your own custom modules, we must **expose** functions _as properties_ on the `exports` object

```js
// square.js: create modules
exports.area = function (width) {
  return width * width;
};
exports.perimeter = function (width) {
  return 4 * width;
};

// app.js: import modules
const square = require("./square");
```

Export a complete object in one assignment, instead of building it one property at a time:

- Assign it to `module.exports`

```js
module.exports = {
  area(width) {
    return width * width;
  },

  perimeter(width) {
    return 4 * width;
  },
};
```

`exports` is

- a shortcut to `module.exports` within a given module.
- a variable that gets initialized to the value of `module.exports` before the module is evaluated
- holds a reference to the same object referenced by `module.exports`
- **assigning another value to `exports` will make it NO LONGER BOUND to `module.exports`**

## Asynchronous API's

Synchronous code: operation must complete before the next operation can start

Asynchronous code: start an operation & immediately return _before the operation is complete_

Non-blocking asynchronous API's are more important on Node than in the browser because:

- Node is a single-threaded & event-driven execution environment
- All server requests are run on the same thread
  - NOT spawned off into separate processes
- Extremely efficient in terms of speed & resources
- However, expensive synchronous code will block the **current request** & **every other request handled by your web app**

### [**Fixing Callback Hell**](http://callbackhell.com/)

Give anonymous functions names

- Easier to read
- When exceptions occur, you get a reference to an actual function name (not anonymous)
- Allows you to move functions & reference them by name

Modularize

- Write small modules that do one thing
- Assemble them into other modules that do a bigger thing
- Easier to understand

Handle Every Single Error

- Makes code more stable
- Plan on them always happening
- Node.js Style: First argument = error
  - Helps you remember to handle errors

```js
function handleFile(error, file) {
  if (error) return console.error("Uhoh, there was an error", error);
  // otherwise, continue on and use `file` in your code
}
```

Summary

- **Don't Nest Functions**: give them names, top level of your app
- **Use function hoisting**: move functions _below the fold_
- **Handle every single error**: use a linter
- **Create reusable functions & place them in a module**: reduce cognitive load required to understand your code. It helps with:
  - Error handling
  - Testing
  - Forces you to create a stable & documented public API for your code
  - Refactoring

### Alternatives to Callbacks

- [`async` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async)
- `Promise`
- `async`/`await`

## Creating Route Handlers

```js
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
```

We define a callback route handler function for HTTP `GET` requests to the site root `/`.

- `req` & `res` objects as arguments
- `.send()` method on the response object returns a string
  - Other response methods include: `.json()`, `.sendFile()`

_Express application_ object provides methods to define route handlers _for all other HTTP verbs_:

- `checkout()`
- `copy()`
- **`delete()`**
- **`get()`**
- `head()`
- `lock()`
- `merge()`
- `mkactivity()`
- `mkcol()`
- `move()`
- `m-search()`
- `notify()`
- `options()`
- `patch()`
- **`post()`**
- `purge()`
- **`put()`**
- `report()`
- `search()`
- `subscribe()`
- `trace()`
- `unlock()`
- `unsubscribe()`

Special method: `app.all()` is called in response to **any HTTP method**

- Used for loading middleware functions at a particular path for all req methods

Example: Handler that will be executed for requests to `/secret`, regardless of the HTTP verb:

```js
app.all("/secret", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log("Accessing the secret sectionâ€¦");
  next(); // pass control to the next handler
});
```

**Routes** allow us to:

- match patterns of characters in a URL
- extract values from the URL
- pass extracted values to the route handler

Grouping route handlers & accessing them via a common route-prefix is useful:

- Achieved in Express by using `express.Router` object
- Adding routes to `Router` object is just like using the `app` object

Example: **Wiki route module**

```js
// wiki.js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

// Home page route
router.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.send("Wiki home page");
});

// About page route
router.get("/about", function (req, res) {
  res.send("About this wiki");
});

module.exports = router;
```

**Main app**: Require route model & call `use()` method on Express app to add the router to **the middleware handling path**

- The above paths `/` & `/about` will be accessed from `/wiki/` & `/wiki/about/`

```js
// app.js
const wiki = require("./wiki,js");
app.use("/wiki", wiki);
```

## Using Middleware

Middleware is used extensively in Express apps:

- Serving static files
- Error handling
- Compressing HTTP responses

Route functions end the HTTP request-response cycle by returning a response to the HTTP client.

Middleware functions _typically_:

- perform an operation on the request or response object
- then call the `next()` function in the "stack", which may be more middleware OR a route handler
- the order = up to the developer
- _can also end the request-response cycle_
- if it doesn't end the cycle, it _must_ call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function

Most apps use **third party middleware** to simplify common web dev tasks:

- cookies
- sessions
- user authentication
- accessing request `POST` & JSON data
- logging
- etc.

[Express team's middleware packages](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html)

Using third party middlware:

```sh
npm install morgan
```

```js
const express = require("express");
// import third party middleware
const logger = require("morgan");
const app = express();

// use third party middleware
app.use(logger("dev"));
```

Middleware/routing functions are called in the order they're declared

- Order is important for some
- Almost always call middleware before setting routes
  - or route handlers will not have access to functionality added by middleware

Middleware = Routes, except middleware functions have a third argument `next`

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// example middleware function
const a_middleware_function = function (req, res, next) {
  // perform some operations
  next(); // call next() so Express will call the next middleware function in the chain.
};

// all routes and verbs: use the middleware
app.use(a_middleware_function);

// specific route / all verbs: use the middleware
app.use("/someroute", a_middleware_function);

// specific route and HTTP verb: use the middleware
app.get("/", a_middleware_function);

app.listen(3000);
```

## Serving Static Files

`express.static` middleware is used to serve up static files:

- images
- css
- javascript

To serve the above files from a directory named `/public`:

```js
app.use(express.static("public"));
```

Any files in the public directory are served by adding filenames, relative to the basic directory:

```sh
http://localhost:3000/images/dog.jpg
http://localhost:3000/css/style.css
http://localhost:3000/js/app.js
http://localhost:3000/about.html
```

`.static()` can be called multiple times.

- if a file can't be found in one middleware function, it is passed to the next middleware function
- in the order that they're declared

```js
app.use(express.static("public"));
app.use(express.static("media"));
```

Virtual prefixes can also be used for static URLs:

```js
app.use("/media", express.static("public"));
```

```sh
http://localhost:3000/media/images/dog.jpg
http://localhost:3000/media/video/cat.mp4
http://localhost:3000/media/cry.mp3
```
