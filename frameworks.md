# Frameworks

**Don't reinvent the wheel**.

Web frameworks fall into 3 categories: **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **CSS** (or UI frameworks).

Web applications often use a lot of _duplicated features_. For example:

- User authentication
- Pages that render
- Connecting to databases
- Profiles to look at
- Stylized feeds of info

Formatting code in specific ways help us become **more efficient** and **help other developers understand our code.**

Frameworks help achieve **structure** and **standardization** in our applications and give us additional features without too much extra work. They allow us to focus **on features**, rather than on configuration details.

**Code is READ many more time than it is written.** It is important that _other developers_ know where code for certain tasks is written so they can use it in their own code.

Most websites share a very similar structure. Frameworks provide a common structure so **developers don't have to redo it from scratch and can the reuse code provided.**

Frameworks are just **code libraries** (other people's code).

## User Interface Frameworks

UI frameworks help create stylized & professional looking web apps. Most include:

- Grid system (aligning elements)
- Color schemes
- Stylize HTML components using CSS

UI Frameworks are within the frontend and typically are JavaScript frameworks.

- Bootstrap
  - Built by twiiter
  - Easy to learn, professional
  - Easy to spot bootstrap sites
  - Difficult to customize
- Materialize
  - Clean looking
  - More fun than bootstrap
  - Lots of styling/color options
  - Follow's Google's Material guide
- Foundation
  - Lots of examples
  - Professional
- Semantic UI
  - Lots of built-in
  - Built-in themes, customizable
- Grommet
  - Huge focus on accessibly
  - Really clean
  - Not as popular as others
  - Made for React JS

## Frontend Frameworks

Frontend frameworks are mostly written in JavaScript.

They organize functionality and interactivity of your site.

- Vue
  - Easy to learn
  - Very fast
  - Tools are packaged well
  - Takes parts from Angular/React and optimizes them
  - Less widely adopted
  - Flexible, useful in many ways
- AngularJS
  - Built by Google
  - Well supported
  - Huge number of features
  - Improves scalability
  - Difficult to debug
  - Large learning curve
- Angular 2+
  - Built by Google
  - Well supported
  - Encourages reusability
  - Improves scalability
  - Large learning curve
- React
  - Built by Facebook
  - Bundles frontend code into components
  - Organizes code/data to make code more reusable
  - Large learning curve
- Ember
  - Large amount of functionality out of the box
  - Opinionated, formatting is enforced
  - Steep learning curve

## Backend Frameworks

- Spring MVC
  - Java
  - Very fast
  - Less opinionated
- Django
  - Python
  - Happy medium between being very opinionated and less structured
  - Gives you a lot of functionality out of the box (like user authentication, database connections, and view rendering)
  - Can be difficult to integrate a fancy front-end.
  - Python's data handling is amazing
- Flask
  - Python (easier language to learn)
  - Less opinionated and more customizable than Django
  - Gives you less out of the box (you have to build more)
- Ruby on Rails
  - Ruby (easier language to learn)
  - Very opinionated
  - Has great tools like scaffolding so you can build things fast
  - Gives you a lot of functionality out of the box (like user authentication, database connections, and view rendering)
  - The asset pipeline helps with front-end development
  - Ruby takes longer to run programs than some other programming languages
- Meteor
  - JavaScript (easier language to learn)
  - Gives you a lot of functionality out of the box (like user authentication, database connections, and view rendering)
  - Integrates very well with modern front-ends
- Express
  - JavaScript (easier language to learn)
  - Very customizable
  - Very lightweight
  - Less built-in features
  - Node is very fast
