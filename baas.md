# Backend As A Service (BaaS)

Unless you use `localStorage`, our apps forget the user's preferences and any changes made, as soon as the page gets reloaded.

Local Storage is great BUT it only stores data on the client's computer. In order to reaccess the data again from a different device, a **real backend** is required.

Backend options:

1. Build a back-end (Node.js)
2. Outsource backend to a BaaS company

   2. [Apigee](http://apigee.com/)
