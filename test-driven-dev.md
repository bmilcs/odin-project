# Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a **big deal** in modern development.

- Start by writing automated tests
- BEFORE writing code that is being tested

Test-Running Systems in JavaScript:

- Mocha
- Jasmine
- Tape
- Jest

> Syntax for all test running systems is very similar.

Benefits:

- Produces clean code that works (goal of TDD)
- Forces us to think through requirements/design before writing functional code
- Keeps you out of the debugger
- Reduces bugs in new/existing features
- Reduces cost of change
- Improves design
- Encourages refactoring
- Builds a safety net to defend against other programmers
- Is Fun
- Speeds up development by eliminating waste
- Reduces fear
- Improves productivity
- Helps devs maintain focus
- Improves communication
- Communicate design decisions
- Loosely-coupled design

## Jest

> installation

```js
npm i -D jest
```

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "watch": "jest --watch *.js",
}
```

> tdd syntax with Jest

```js
// somefile.test.js
it("description", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1); // pass
});

it("ordertotal, single item", () => {
  expect(
    orderTotal({
      items: [{ name: "dragon candy", price: 2, quantity: 3 }],
    }).toBe(6)
  );
});
```

> running jest

```sh
npm run test # single test
npm run watch # continuous feedback loop
```

### Common Matchers

`.toBe()` uses `Object.is` to test exact equality.

To check the value **of an object**, use `.toEqual()` or `toStrictEqual()` instead.

- `toStrictEqual()` is _preferred_
- `toEqual()` ignores undefined

```js
test("object assignment", () => {
  const data = { one: 1 };
  data["two"] = 2;
  expect(data).toEqual({ one: 1, two: 2 });
});
```

To test the inverse of something, add `.not` to the matcher:

```js
test("add positive numbers is not zero", () => {
  for (let a = 1; a < 10; a++) {
    for (let b = 1; b < 10; b++) {
      expect(a + b).not.toBe(0);
    }
  }
});
```

**Truthiness Matchers:**

- `toBeNull`
- `toBeUndefined`
- `toBeDefined`
- `toBeTruthy`
- `toBeFalsy`

**Numbers:**

- `toBeGreaterThan`
- `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual`
- `toBeLessThan`
- `toBeLessThanOrEqual`
- `toBeCloseTo` \* floating point equality
  - ie: `0.1 + 0.2` `.toBeCloseTo(0.3)`-- NOT `.toBe()`

**Strings** Using Regex

- `toMatch(/stop/)`

```js
test("there is no I in team", () => {
  expect("team").not.toMatch(/I/);
});

test('but there is a "stop" in Christoph', () => {
  expect("Christoph").toMatch(/stop/);
});
```

**Arrays & Iterables**

- `toContain`

```js
const shoppingList = [
  "diapers",
  "kleenex",
  "trash bags",
  "paper towels",
  "milk",
];

test("the shopping list has milk on it", () => {
  expect(shoppingList).toContain("milk");
  expect(new Set(shoppingList)).toContain("milk");
});
```

**Exceptions** Error Throwing

To test if a function will throw an error: `.toThrow`

```js
expect(() => compileAndroidCode()).toThrow();
expect(() => compileAndroidCode()).toThrow(Error);
```

### Asynchronous Code Tests

Promises:

```js
test("the data is peanut butter", () => {
  return fetchData().then((data) => {
    expect(data).toBe("peanut butter");
  });
});
```

Async/Await:

```js
test("the data is peanut butter", async () => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  expect(data).toBe("peanut butter");
});

test("fetch fails w/ error", async () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  try {
    await fetchData();
  } catch (e) {
    expect(e).toMatch("error");
  }
});
```

Async/Await with `.resolves` or `.rejects`

```js
test("data is peanut butter", async () => {
  await expect(fetchData()).resolves.toBe("peanut butter");
});

test("fetch fails w/ error", async () => {
  await expect(fetchData()).rejects.toMatch("error");
});
```

### Repeating Setup

If work needs to be repeated for many tests, you can use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks.

> Example: several tests that interact with a database

```js
beforeEach(() => initializeCityDatabase());
afterEach(() => clearCityDatabase());

test("city database has Vienna", () => {
  expect(isCity("Vienna")).toBeTruthy();
});
```

`beforeEach` and `afterEach` can handle async code like `tests`:

- take a `done` parameter
- return a `promise`

```js
// if initializeCityDatabase() returned a promise that resolved
// when the db was initialized, we want to return that promise:

beforeEach(() => {
  return initializeCityDatabase();
});
```

### One-Time Setup

In some cases, you only need to setup once, at the beginning of a file. To prevent setups from running before each test, use `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks:

```js
beforeAll(() => {
  return initializeCityDatabase();
});
afterAll(() => {
  return clearCityDatabase();
});
test("city database has Vienna", () => {
  expect(isCity("Vienna")).toBeTruthy();
});
test("city database has San Juan", () => {
  expect(isCity("San Juan")).toBeTruthy();
});
```

### Scoping

By default, `beforeAll` and `afterAll` blocks apply to every test in a file.

To group tests together, use a `describe` block. When inside a `describe` block, `beforeAll`/`afterAll` blocks apply to tests within the `describe` block only.

```js
describe("matching cities to foods", () => {
  // Applies only to tests in this describe block
  beforeEach(() => {
    return initializeFoodDatabase();
  });

  test("Vienna <3 veal", () => {
    expect(isValidCityFoodPair("Vienna", "Wiener Schnitzel")).toBe(true);
  });

  test("San Juan <3 plantains", () => {
    expect(isValidCityFoodPair("San Juan", "Mofongo")).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Order of Execution

Jest executes

1. ALL `describe` handlers in a file first
2. Actual tests second

After `describe` blocks are complete, Jest runs all the tests in the order they were encountered in the collection phase. Each test waits on the previous test to complete before beginning.

```js
beforeEach(() => console.log("connection setup"));
beforeEach(() => console.log("database setup"));

afterEach(() => console.log("database teardown"));
afterEach(() => console.log("connection teardown"));

test("test 1", () => console.log("test 1"));

describe("extra", () => {
  beforeEach(() => console.log("extra database setup"));
  afterEach(() => console.log("extra database teardown"));

  test("test 2", () => console.log("test 2"));
});

// connection setup
// database setup
// test 1
// database teardown
// connection teardown

// connection setup
// database setup
// extra database setup
// test 2
// extra database teardown
// database teardown
// connection teardown
```

### General Advice

If a test is failing, one of the **first things to check** should be:

- If that test fails when it's the _only test_ that runs.
- To complete a single test within a test file containing many tests, change `test` to `test.only`

```js
// test.only
test.only("this will be the only test that runs", () => {
  expect(true).toBe(false);
});

// ignored with test.only present
test("this test will not run", () => {
  expect("A").toBe("A");
});
```

If a test passes when it's alone but fails as part of a larger suite, **it's a good bet that something from a _different_ test is interfering**.

- Can often fix this by clearing a shared state with `beforeEach`
- Can also use a `beforeEach` statement to log data

### Mock Tests

Running lots of tests to API's can become unfeasible: charging credit cards, etc.

Examples: VAT (value added tax) varies based on the country. [VAT API](https://vatapi.com/).

- Change thinking process
-

```js
function orderTotal(fetch, order) {
  fetch();
  return Promise.resolve(
    order.items.reduce((prev, cur) => cur.price * (cur.quantity || 1) + prev, 0)
  );
}

module.exports = orderTotal;
```

```js
//  sandbox.js
const fetch = require("node-fetch");

const result = fetch("vatapi.com/...")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => data.rates.standard.value);
```

> Change tests to expect a promise

```js
const orderTotal = require("./order-total");
const emptyFunction = () => {};

it("calls vatapi.com if country code specified", () => {
  let isFakeFetchCalled = false;
  const fakeFetch = (url) => {
    isFakeFetchCalled = true;
  };
  orderTotal(fakeFetch, {
    country: "DE",
    items: [{ name: "dragon waffles", price: 20, quantity: 2 }],
  }).then((result) => expect(isFakeFetchCalled).toBe(true));
});

it("no qty specified", () =>
  orderTotal(emptyFunction, {
    items: [{ name: "dragon candy", price: 3 }],
  }).then((result) => expect(result).toBe(3)));
```

## More Testing

Another important basic concept is **testing in isolation.** Only one method should be tested at a time and your tests should not depend on an external function behaving correctly --- especially if that function's being tested elsewhere.

Main reason for testing in isolation:

- When tests fail, you want to be able to narrow down the cause of this failure as quickly as possible
- If a test depends on several functions, it can be difficult to tell what exactly is going wrong

## Pure Functions

Tightly coupled code is hard to test.

For example:

```js
function guessingGame() {
  const magicNumber = 22;
  const guess = prompt("guess a number between 1 and 100!");
  if (guess > magicNumber) {
    alert("YOUR GUESS IS TOO BIG");
  } else if (guess < magicNumber) {
    alert("YOUR GUESS IS TOO SMALL");
  } else if (guess == magicNumber) {
    alert("YOU DID IT! ðŸŽ‰");
  }
}
```

Making this testable requires splitting up **all the different things that are happening.** What we need to test is the number logic, which is much easier to untangle it:

```js
function evaluateGuess(magicNumber, guess) {
  // * Only function that needs to be tested*
  if (guess > magicNumber) {
    return "YOUR GUESS IS TOO BIG";
  } else if (guess < magicNumber) {
    return "YOUR GUESS IS TOO SMALL";
  } else if (guess == magicNumber) {
    return "YOU DID IT! ðŸŽ‰";
  }
}

function guessingGame() {
  const magicNumber = 22;
  const guess = prompt("guess a number between 1 and 100!");
  const message = evaluateGuess(magicNumber, guess);
  alert(message);
}

guessingGame();
```

This implementation is much nicer:

- Clear input
- Clear output
- Doesn't call any external functions
- Easier to extend

If this was written _with TDD_, it would have looked more like the 2nd example.

**TDD encourages better program architecture** because it encourges us to write **PURE FUNCTIONS.**

## Mocking

Tightly coupled code has two solutions:

1. Best\*: Remove those dependencies, as we did in example 2.
2. **Mocking**: writing fake versions of a function that always behaves exactly how you want.

Mocking example: testing a function that gets info from DOM input. You don't want to have to setup a webpage and dynamically insert something into the input just to run your tests.

With a mock function, we can create a fake version of the input-grabbing that always returns a specific value --- and use THAT in your test.

## [Why I use Tape Instead of Mocha & So Should You](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-i-use-tape-instead-of-mocha-so-should-you-6aa105d8eaf4)

_Too much mocking_ can be a bad thing. It is _sometimes_ necessary, but if you have to setup an elaborate system of mocks to test any bit of your code, that means **your code is too tightly coupled.**

One thing you should NEVER do: **Share state between tests**.

Testing is NOT what you should spend most of your time doing.

Test assertions (`.equal`, `.deepEqual`) should be **dead simple** and completely free of magic. WHY?

- Provide quality info about expectations
- Lead to concise test cases
- Easy to read & maintain

Test cases should be written just like a bug report:

1. Describe the feature you're testing in plain English.
2. Provide expected outcome.
3. Compare expectation to the actual value.

When a unit test fails, the _error message_ is your _bug report._

- Your automated test error messages are your bug reports.

Your test descriptions should be clear enough to use as documentation:

```js
import test from "tape";

test("A passing test", (assert) => {
  assert.pass("This test will pass.");
  assert.end();
});

test("Assertions with tape.", (assert) => {
  const expected = "something to test";
  const actual = "sonething to test";

  assert.equal(
    actual,
    expected,
    "Given two mismatched values, .equal() should produce a nice bug report"
  );

  assert.end();
});
```

## [Mocking is a Code Smell](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/mocking-is-a-code-smell-944a70c90a6a)

Mocking becomes a requirement when there is coupling between units and unit isolation is needed for testing.

**Tight Coupling**: Rigid, brittle code - more likely to break when changes are needed

**Less Coupling**: Easy to extend & maintain. Testing becomes easier, which is a bonus side effect.

If we're mocking something, there may be a way to reduce coupling and make our code more flexible.

**Coupling**: Degree to which a module, function, class, etc. depends on other units of code. Coupling comes in many forms:

- **Subclass Coupling**: _inheritance_
- **Control Dependencies**: _code that controls its dependencies by telling them what to do_.
  - Passing method names
  - If control API of dependency changes, dependent code breaks.
- **Mutable State Dependencies**: _code that shares a mutable state w/ other code_
  - Can change properties on a shared object
  - If relative timing of mutations change, dependent code can break
- **State Shape Dependencies**: _code that shres data structures with other code & only uses a subset of the structure_
- **Event/message coupling**: _code that communicates w/ units via message passing, events, etc._

**Tight Coupling**:

- **Mutation** vs immutability
- **Side-Effects** vs purity/isolated side-effects
- **Responsibility Overload** vs Do One Thing (DOT)
- **Procedural Instructions** vs describing structure
- **Class Inheritance** vs composition

Imperative/Object-oriented code is more susceptible to tight coupling.

Functional code is less susceptible. Functional code uses **pure functions** as the core unit of composition and are less vulnerable to tight coupling by nature.

**Pure Functions**:

- Given the same input, always return the same output
- Produce no side-effects
- **Immutability**: Don't mutate existing values. They return new ones instead.
- **No Side Effects**: Only thing pure functions do is return a value. It doesn't interfere with the operation of other functions.
- **Do One Thing** (DOT): Avoid responsibility overload, which plague object & class-based code.
- **Structure, not instructions**: Pure functions can be replaced with a lookup table (input/output values).
  - Pure functions describe _the structural relationship between data_ - NOT instructions for the computer to follow

### Composition & Mocking

Software development: process of breaking large problem into smaller, independent pieces (**_decomposition_**) and composing the solutions to form an app that solves the large problem (**_composition_**).

**Mocking is required WHEN our decomposition strategy has failed.**

When decomposition succeeds, we can use a generic composition utility to compose the pieces back together:

- Function composition: `lodash/fp/compose`
- Component Composition: composing higher-order components w/ function composition
- State store/model composition: Redux combineReducers
- Object or factory composition: mixins, functional mixins
- Process composition: transducers
- Promise/monadic composition: `asyncPipe()`, `composeM()`

**Function composition** = applying a function to the return value of another function.

- Create pipeline of functions
- Pass value to pipeline
- Value goes thru each function (stage in an assembly line)
- Transforms value in some way before it's passed to the next function in the pipeline
- Last function returns final value

```js
const pipe =
  (...fns) =>
  (x) =>
    fns.reduce((y, f) => f(y), x);
// Applying a function to the return value of another function
const pipe =
  (...fns) =>
  (val) =>
    fns.reduce((prevVal, fun) => fun(prevVal), val);

// EXAMPLE
// initialValue -> [plusOne] -> [timesTwo] -> result
const plusOne = (n) => n + 1;
const timesTwo = (n) => n * 2;

const declarativeComposition = pipe(plusOne, timesTwo);
console.log(declarativeComposition(20));
```

This is the **primary means of organizing application code** in _every_ mainstream language, regardless of paradigm.

JavaScript has _first-class functions_, which allows you to compose functions automatically (declaratively).

- Imperative: commanding the computer to do something step by step
- Declarative: telling computer the relationships between things
  - A description of structure using equational reasoning

`declarativeComposition()` is the **piped composition** of `plusOne` and `timesTwo`.

### How To Remove Coupling

Loose Coupling:

- Module imports without side-effects
- Message passing/pubsub
- Immutable parameters

To remove coupling:

- **Use Pure Functions** as the atomic unit of composition
  - Instead of classes, imperative procedures, mutating functions
- **Isolate Side-Effects** from the rest of your logic.
  - Don't mix logic with I/O (network I/O, rendering UI, logging)
- **Remove Dependent Logic** from imperative compositions

DON'T unit test I/O.

I/O is for integrations. Use integration tests, instead.

_It's perfectly okay to mock and fake for integration tests._

### Pure Functions

Pure functions

- Can't mutate global variables
- Can't mutate arguments passed into them
- Can't mutate the network
- Can't mutate the disk
- Can't mutate the screen

Pure functions can ONLY **return a value**.

If passed an array/object, pure functions have to create a new copy of the array/object with the require changes.

- Arrays methods: `concat`, `filter`, `map`,`reduce`,`slice`
- Object methods: `Object.assign`

```js
// NOT PURE * BAD
const signInUser = (user) => (user.isSignedIn = true);
const foo = {
  name: "Foo",
  isSignedIn: false,
};
// Foo was mutated * BAD
console.log(
  signInUser(foo), // true
  foo // { name: "Foo", isSignedIn: true }
);

// VERSUS
// PURE * GOOD -> returns a new object
const signInUser = (user) => ({ ...user, isSignedIn: true });
const foo = {
  name: "Foo",
  isSignedIn: false,
};
// Foo was not mutated
console.log(
  signInUser(foo), // { name: "Foo", isSignedIn: true }
  foo // { name: "Foo", isSignedIn: false } * NOT MUTATED
);
```

Performance hits due to returning a new object

- Side-effect: we can detect changes to objects by using `===` identity comparison
- Don't have to traverse through an entire object to discover changes

Pure functions can be memoized: cache/save pre-calculated values in a lookup table.

Pure functions allow you to safely distribute complex computations over large clusters of processors (divide & conquer).
